CHAPTER I. The Curious Clocktower

Lydia had grown quite accustomed to spending her afternoons beneath the old
elm tree behind her grandmother’s house, but on this particular day she felt
far too restless to sit still. The breeze was warm, the clouds were drifting
lazily overhead, and yet she had the peculiar sense that something unusual
was about to happen.

She toyed with the idea of sketching in her notebook, or perhaps taking a walk
to the river, but neither seemed interesting enough. Just as she sighed and
leaned back against the bark, a faint metallic ticking sounded behind her.
Lydia turned—and to her astonishment, a bright brass pocket-watch came hopping
through the grass on its tiny mechanical legs.

At first she could only stare. There was nothing especially remarkable about a
pocket-watch, of course, but a pocket-watch that moved on its own, clicked its
gears impatiently, and seemed very much in a hurry—that was quite another
matter. The watch paused, spun its little hands twice, and then darted toward
the old clocktower at the edge of the field.

Without stopping to wonder whether this was sensible, Lydia snatched up her
notebook, sprang to her feet, and hurried after it. She arrived just in time
to see the watch squeeze through a narrow crack beneath the clocktower door.

In another moment Lydia slipped inside after it—never once considering why a
clocktower would need a doorway only sized for secrets.
